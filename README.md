# Intent Experiment

Just trying out code. Run `./run.sh` to install and compile everything as needed, then run the intent parser. Enter text to see how it gets parsed. The actual intents are in [intents.yaml](./intents.yaml)

This uses Snips. Intent format is described [here](https://snips-nlu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dataset.html). Some [more info here](https://snips-nlu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_model.html) and based on the howto from [here](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-nlu)
